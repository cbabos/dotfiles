## Basic environment
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/)
* [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
* [Browsersync](http://browsersync.io/)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
* [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
* [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

## Configurations
I've created / copied and modifed some configuration files from [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) (thanks for his hard work on his repo, and of course thanks for sharing it with the world :))

A small list about the topic of what configurations have this repo: 

* iTerm2 settings (colorscheme, used fonts, etc.)
* Oh-My-Zsh configuration (original agnoster theme, some plugins activated, etc.)
* OS X system and UI settings
